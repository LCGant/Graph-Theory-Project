# Graph Theory Project

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm as a solution to the proposed problem: Finding the shortest path in an undirected graph, which uses dynamic memory allocation.

## How to Run the Code

1. Compile the code using a C compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc -o graph_theory graph_theory.c

2. Run the program:
    ```
    ./graph_theory
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a graph or select a predefined example graph.

## Example Graphs

The program includes three predefined example graphs that can be selected at runtime. You can also input your own graph by specifying the vertices and edges.

## Development Environment

- IDE: DEV-C++ 5.11
- Compiler: MinGW (included with DEV-C++)
- Operating System: Windows 10

This project was developed and tested using the above tools. If you encounter issues, ensure that your environment matches these specifications as closely as possible.
